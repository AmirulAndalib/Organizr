# How to Contribute #

We're always looking for people to help make Organizr better.

## Documentation ##
[Docs](https://docs.organizr.app)

## Development ##

### Tools required ###
- Any IDE of your choice that supports PHP, HTML and Javascript.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Getting started ###

1. Fork Organizr
2. Clone the repository into your development machine. [*info*](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github)
3. Get to work

### Contributing Code ###
- If you're adding a new, already requested feature, please make a new Github issue so work is not duplicated (If you want to add something not already on there, please talk to us first)
- Rebase from Organizr's `develop` branch, don't merge
- Make meaningful commits, or squash them
- Feel free to make a pull request before work is complete, this will let us see where its at and make comments/suggest improvements
- One feature/bug fix per pull request to keep things clean and easy to understand

### Pull Requesting ###
- Only make pull requests to develop (currently v2-develop), never master, if you make a PR to master we'll comment on it and close it
- You're probably going to get some comments or questions from us, they will be to ensure consistency and maintainability
- We'll try to respond to pull requests as soon as possible, if its been a day or two, please reach out to us, we may have missed it

If you have any questions about any of this, please let us know.
